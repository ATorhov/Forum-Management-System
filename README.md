### Use Cases

**Scenario 1**

*A friend of Pavel’s told him about this amazing forum, where lots of people share their ideas and perspectives on the crypto/stock market. Pavel enters the website and sees a feed of posts. He can sort them by most liked or newest. He can also filter them by a certain word/s. He is an anonymous user so he cannot create a post yet. He registers and then logs in to the forum. He can now start sharing his ideas with his buddy crypto “hodlers.”*

**Scenario 2**

*Your forum has accumulated thousands of new users. Most of them are proactively helpful and positive, but some of them started posting spam or/and irrelevant information to the forum. You hire a moderator. You instruct the moderator to enter the forum and create a first-time registration. You as an admin give admin rights to your moderator through the forum. They can now start deleting posts and ban users that do not follow the forum rules!*

**Technical Requirements**

<ins>General · Follow OOP principles when coding · Follow KISS, SOLID, DRY principles when coding · Follow REST API design best practices when designing the REST API (see Appendix)

    * Use tiered project structure (separate the application in layers)

    * The service layer (i.e., "business" functionality) must have at least 80%-unit test code coverage

    * You should implement proper exception handling and propagation

    * Try to think ahead. When developing something, think – “How hard would it be to change/modify this later?”

### Optional Requirements

· Integrate your project with a Continuous Integration server (e.g., GitLab’s own) and configure your unit tests to run on each commit to your master branch

· Host your application's backend in a public hosting provider of your choice (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku)

· Use branches while working with Git
